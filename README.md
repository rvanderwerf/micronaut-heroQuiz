# Micronaut Alexa Hello World Example

This Example is the [Hello World](https://alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-java.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Developing-Your-First-Skill.html) sample application written with Micronaut and Alexa.

The application can be build with either Gradle (which builds the JAR to the `build/libs` directory):

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

Or Maven which builds the JAR to the `target` directory:

```bash
./mvnw package
```
